Hello world! This is Hamsoft's Rust-based web app, built using Yew.

This is meant to be a fairly robust (and educational!) site, so we're here to do things the !!FUN!! way.

Running the Dev Server
    1. Spin up the dev container
    2. `cd yew-app`
    3. `ts` or `trunk serve`

Build the app for release using
    build --release.
