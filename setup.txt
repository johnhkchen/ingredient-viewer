Setup Instructions (The first!)

Overview
    This document will describe how the project was created, and server as a blueprint for containerizing the app.

    This project is set up using the Yew Rust framework, so learning a bit about Yew and Rust is recommended. However, you're not expected to understand a ton about Yew and Rust to be able to understand this document.

Dev Environment Setup
    Install Rust
        Execute the rustup-init script (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

    Set brower-based WebAssembly compilation target
        rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

    Install Trunk, a build tool
        cargo install trunk

    Build and run a sample app
        cargo new yew-app
        cd yew-app
        cargo run
             
        > Running `target/debug/yew-app`
        > Hello, world!
    
    Converting the project into a Yew web application
        Update Cargo.toml, adding yew as a dependency. The latest version can be checked at:
            https://crates.io/crates/yew/versions
        
        Change the main.rs file with yew's loader, and add an index.html file to the root of the application (yew-app/index.html)

        Run the dev server using
            trunk serve

        Build the app for release using
            build --release.
