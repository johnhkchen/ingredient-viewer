These are manual steps that we did to get the code to work from the base devcontainer definition.

As such, they are good candidates for automation.

Dependencies

1. cargo install trunk
2. WASM bindings for Yew rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

Cool shortcuts

clean
    Remove unimportant files?

ts
    trunk serve

dcu - docker-compose up: 
dcu test
dcu staging
dcu production


Desired workflow:

VS Code -> Open in Container -> ts
