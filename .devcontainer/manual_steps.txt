These are manual steps that we did to get the code to work from the base devcontainer definition.

As such, they are good candidates for automation.

Manual Steps:

    cargo install --locked --version 0.15.0 trunk
    cd /yew-app
    cargo build


Desired Shortcuts:

ts
    trunk serve

dcu - docker-compose up: 
dcu test
dcu e2e
dcu staging
dcu production


Desired workflow:

VS Code -> Open in Container -> ts or dcu test
